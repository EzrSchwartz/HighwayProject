__Tuesday, May 12th__

  That day I started to brainstorm about projects. From my prior projects I know that I want to work on somehting with computer vision and incorperating this with my other interests to keep people safe. I knew that this was hard to combine all of these interests and make one project out of it all.

  Started to figure out that I wanted to do something with a dashcam and AI. I want to have it all combined into one safety device that will be able to aid drivers in paying attention to the road. I have multiple friends who have been hit by cars while cycling on the road (im a cyclist myself) and I want drivers to be aware of their surroundings to lower the chance of events such as those happening.

  Started the basic design concept of what I need to get done and what I need to make this work. I made some rough drafts of what components and how the components would need to interact. I realize that I need to have a PCB to seamlessly integrate the IMU and Raspberry Pi.


__Saturday and Sunday, May 16th-17th__

  Talked to some friends who have helped me previously, and I competed in CyberQuest with. They shared some ideas to add eye tracking into the mix so you can see how the driver is focused and what they are looking at. 

__Monday-Thursday, May 18th-22nd__

  Conversed with teachers and started to make a more thought-out plan. Started to finish my PCB schematics. I prepared my project to work and to incorperate all my sensors together.

  Submitted the project
