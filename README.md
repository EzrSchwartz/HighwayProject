# HighwayProject
Driving device to track your driving performance based on: acceleration, eye focus/attention, phone usage, and your interactions with other cars.



Experience:
Machine learning for automatic bike shifters (Patent Pending) Autoshift
Circuit python community bundle contributor for the BLE Power Service BLE Library (one of 69 in the world)
Developed a CNN to more accurately diagnose rotator cuff tears using a novel approach of utilizing U-Nets for encoder training in double transfer learning (I can send my paper if needed)
Visualizing Deforestation with GEE through remote sensing VisualDeforestation
Have experience building FPV drones and microcontrollers.
3rd in CT for health research proposals for similar study of rotator cuff but focused on the glenoid labrum
1st place in CT for the Lockheed Martin Cyberquest, a competition that focuses on cybersecurity through the CTF format.
Sole developer of the TeenTaskR app which will be launched in 1 week (an app to allow local parents to hire students and connect with them for odd jobs and small gigs)

Why do I want to build this: Since driving I have realized that although I possess the skills of road awareness due to my previous competitive cycling background, most people do not especially when just starting to drive. This leads them to not know where they should be looking or what dangers they should watch out for. I have seen many of my friends almost crash because of this lack of understanding. Creating a device that would assist them to be see where the dangers may lie and how they can improve their awareness would be very crucial.

I'm designing: the PCB to incorporate  all of the sensors will be incorporated including the raspberry pi 4. 

BOM
Main Brain --> raspberry pi 4 $50

Eye tracking camera --> Arducam 8MP IMX219 $25

I have the forward facing camera (I will repurpose a high quality FPV camera)

IMU Sensor --> Adafruit Breakout board IMU fusion $25

Power Supply --> 5V 4A USB-C car charger or buck converter $15

OBD adapter --> usb elm327 $25

PCB estimate $75

Misc $25

Total --> $340
